'''
Given a string of opening and closing parentheses, check
whether it’s balanced. We have 3 types of parentheses:
round brackets: (), square brackets: [], and curly brackets: {}.
Assume that the string doesn’t contain any other character than
these, no spaces words or numbers. As a reminder, balanced
parentheses require every opening parenthesis to be closed in
the reverse order opened. For example ‘([])’ is balanced but ‘([)]’ is not.

You can assume the input string has no spaces.
